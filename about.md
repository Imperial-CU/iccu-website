## The Christian Union at Imperial is a society which aims to make sure that every single student hears about and has the opportunity to respond to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

We hold weekly events for those wanting to explore our faith, such as Skeptical and Curious Cafe, as well as other events for the Christian Union community, where everyone is welcome to join us!

We also put on an annual Events Week - a week of fun events in the Spring Term which engages in how Christianity is relevant to different areas of life.

***

All our events during the year and regular activities are run by an awesome team of volunteers! Do get in touch with us if you want to help make sure our events run smoothly, or serve the CU in other areas.
