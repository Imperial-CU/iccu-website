When you arrive in a new town, it’s important to find a new church. We’ve put together some information about a couple of local churches below. As well as these, ask around, as there’ll be lots of people wanting to invite you to their church! UCCF has also provided some great advice on deciding which church to go to.

We’ve kept the list to a small number of churches close by to Imperial and/or that are popular among Christian Union members – please don’t feel limited by this selection. If you are struggling to find a church that you feel comfortable with, or that you feel matches your religious background, please get in touch and we will do all that we can to help you!

If you’re not familiar with London, use the map below to see where each of the listed churches are, in relation to Imperial College campuses and halls.

## We exist to share the message of Jesus on campus, and explore how this message relates to each and every one of us as we go through university together.

ICCU is a community that believes that the message Jesus spoke is true: that he himself is God, and we can personally know him. We believe that knowing Jesus is essential for all things including life and death. That's why we want to introduce him to everyone.

Whether you'd call yourself a Christian, or wouldn't but are interested in the Christian faith, we'd love to welcome you to our events on campus!
