## Thanks for your interest in financially giving to Imperial College Christian Union. We are incredibly grateful to everyone who helps resource us financially to help with our work in proclaiming the Gospel on campus!

We can currently run all our events by God’s provision through donations from alumni, current members and local churches. However, we’re prayerfully seeking to sustain and grow our outreach, and we need more resources to do so. We would love if you could consider partnering with us to support the our work in reaching the students of Imperial for Jesus.

# Giving regularly
A helpful way to support ICCU financially is to set up a regular standing order, as this enables us to plan our outreach mindful of our future finances.

1. Set up a standing order with your bank:
  - **Account name:** Imperial College Union Clubs and Societies
  - **Bank Name:** Natwest PLC
  - **Account number:** 0061 8152
  - **Sort code:** 51-50-01
  - **Reference:** ChristianUnion222
2. **Email us** at cu@imperial.ac.uk with a statement of the standing order's **date, amount and length of recurrence**, and a **declaration that you understand it is donation and expect nothing in return**.

The Students’ Union finance team requires this statement as proof to exempt your donation from having VAT charged on it and to cross-reference your donation so that the full amount reaches the Christian Union.
