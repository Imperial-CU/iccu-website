# FOUND London 2019

There will also be evening events every night at All Souls Church in Oxford Circus. It is a part of the London-wide Mission Week "FOUND". The speaker this year is Mike Cain, who'll be giving talks about what the Bible has to say about the God who fully seeks, finds, knows and loves real people.
