# Imperial College Christian Union Website

The ICCU website, powered by Jekyll.

## Editing for non-tech geeks

### Style guide

Please follow these few rules when you're making changes to make sure we stay consistent and to keep the website friendly to users:
- **24 hour time** - Imperial is a very international university, so **always** use HH:MM to avoid any confusion or ambiguity.
  - 16:00, not 4 O'clock, 4pm, 04:00pm, 16.00 or 4 and definitely not 16
  - 12:00, not 12 or 12 noon and definitely not lunchtime
- **<i>Weekday dd Month yyyy</i> date format** - put the day of the week unless it's obvious from the context, like within a paragraph about Skeptical where it's already clear that it happens on Fridays only. Keep the year so readers know information is up-to-date and not stale from years ago. **Never use short dates.**
  - e.g. Monday 22nd April 2018 or Monday 22 April 2018
  - not 22nd April, 22/4/18, April 22nd 2018 or Monday the 22nd April
- **Don't abbreviate or shorten venue names.**
  - Huxley, not Hux or HXLY
  - Royal School of Mines, not RSM
- **Follow [Imperial College and Imperial College Union's House Style](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/sites/default/files/files/Union-Brand-Guidelines-2017%3A18.pdf).** Some highlights:
  - 2017/18, not 2017-18 or 2017/2018
  - Imperial College Union, never ICU, which also means *Intensive Care Unit*
  - email, not e-mail
  - -ise and -isation, not -ize and ization
  - Capitalise:
    - Union
    - College
  - disabled people, not the disabled or people with disabilities
- **Gospel, not gospel.**
- **Capitalising on God.** Capitalise names of God, but not pronouns referring to God.
  - Saviour, King, Deliverer
  - he, your, you, him
- **Mind your language.**
  - Use clear and concise sentences. Avoid sentences with lots of clauses or that exceed around 20 words
  - Don't use a long word when a short one will do (stolen from The Economist Style Guide)
  - Clarity is King (well, Jesus is, but you get the point)
- **"Don't be too Christian"** - make sure your tone and word choices are friendly to readers from outside the stripy-top-wearing, quiche-loving community Christian community. There is no need to use "overly-Christian" jargon when you can use "normal" language without compromising on the point you want to get across.

### Step 1: GitHub account

Make yourself an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and ask on the #website channel on the Slack to be added to the [Imperial CU GitHub team](https://github.com/Imperial-CU)

### Step 2: Learn Markdown

It's dead simple, even if you do think you're technologically incompetent. [Here's a nice guide.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Step 3: Setting up the editor
Go to [prose.io](https://prose.io), click *Authorise on GitHub* and sign in with your GitHub account. You shouldn't see anything there.

Go to [this link](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/c602a8bd54b1e774f864) and click *Grant* next to *Imperial-CU*.

Now refresh [prose.io](https://prose.io) and voila! `iccu-website` has appeared! **You're now ready to edit! Hooray!**

### Step 4: Editing the website!
**How do I add an image?** Don't upload massive images - imagine a screen is 1200px wide and resize your picture accordingly. We don't want to drain visitors' mobile data! (If you're *replacing* an image, go to `assets/img` and delete the old image first.) In any folder, click the green *New File* button, then click the picture icon (fourth from the left), and upload your image. Give it a sensible file name (keep it inside `assets/img`) and click *Insert*. Then, (counter-intuitively) hit the back button **without saving**. Strangely, that's it.

**ACHTUNG! something.yml files - it's a YAML file, so it's just bullet-points (dashes) and `field: value` pairs. Quote marks for values are optional but it's safer to include them, especially if the text has symbols or punctuation. Correct indentation is important - it won't work otherwise!** It's pretty obvious - you should be able to work it out. A hash character (`#`) is a comment, meaning the line (or everything after it) gets ignored. Comments are usually there to help others working on the file, for example, instructions.

**How do I...**
- **edit churches on the *Find a Church* page?** Go to `_data/churches.yml` and make changes there*.
- **edit committee profiles on the *About Us* page?** Go to `_data/committee.yml` and make changes there.
- **edit the regular events?** Go to `_data/regular_events.yml` and make changes there.
- **change the three featured items on the home page?** Go to `_data/home_tiles.yml` and make changes there.
- **edit the text or images on a page (other than the home page)?** In the [home folder](http://prose.io/#Imperial-CU/iccu-website), open the relevant `something.md` file and change that.
- **edit the home page?** `_layouts/default.html`. It's in HTML and not Markdown, so it's a bit more difficult to edit, but changing text should be easy enough. Ask on the Slack if you're not sure.
- **change the links in the main menu?** Go to `_data/navbar.yml` and make changes there.
- **add a new page?** Click *New File* in the home folder, give it a title, then click the Meta Data button (third one down on the right) and follow the instructions. Then, you can start writing in Markdown.
- **change the links at the bottom of the page in the middle (about us etc.)?** Go to `_data/footer_links.yml` and make changes there.
- **add a link to a survey or something like iccu.co.uk/survey?** Add `survey.md` in the _redirects folder and in it, put this:
  ```
  ---
  newUrl: https://google.com/really_long_google_form_url
  ---
  ```

After you've made changes, click the save button on the right. It will then tell you to describe your changes. Write something clear and concise about what you did - good practice is to begin with a verb, for example:
```
correct CCK's Sunday morning service time
```
then click *Commit*. **But you're not done yet!**

The staging server is now building the website with your changes added. [You can see its live progress here.](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wonderful-engelbart-98ae8d/deploys). It should take less than 30 seconds. Now, your changes have been made to [the staging website at staging.iccu.co.uk](https://staging.iccu.co.uk). Make sure what you've done works, looks good and/or reads well! If it does, you're ready to submit a *Pull Request* (PR), which is a request for others to review what you've done and approve it, before it goes [live on iccu.co.uk](http://iccu.co.uk). (You can have multiple commits per PR.)

### Step 5: Raise a Pull Request
Changes look good on staging? [Click here to raise a pull request.](https://github.com/Imperial-CU/iccu-website/compare/master...Imperial-CU:staging) Click the big green button and follow the instructions.
- **Title**: What have you done? Fix typo? Add church? Correct information about church x?
- **Comment (optional)**: What? Why? You can use Markdown here.
- **Reviewers** (on the right, optional): Choose any specific people you want to review what you've done.

Then click *Create pull request*. A message will be sent to the Slack to make people aware, and then they can approve it or add comments. When it's approved, the approver should *Merge* it.

### Looking at other people's Pull Requests
Open the link. Read the comment and then click on the *Files changed* tab to see what the submitter has actually done. Click the green *Review changes* button and choose one of the options. If it's an approval, click the purple *Merge* button. If you want someone else to have a look first before going live, but you are happy, leave a comment saying something like *lgtm* but select *Comment*, not *Approve*.
